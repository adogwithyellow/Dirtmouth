A content-focused Balatro mod based on Team Cherry's Hollow Knight. (Silksong content will be made after a majority of HK stuff is functioning.)

Incredibly incomplete and WIP right now, almost no art and mechanics are done, only some Jokers work properly.  
  

Current plans:  
  
A ton of Jokers  
Some new Consumables  
Custom Decks (one with a unique mechanic)  
Custom Challenges  
Joker upgrade mechanic (mod-specific Jokers only)
